### Where can I get it?

### Why doesn't it use my headphone remote?
That would be awesome. If you know how, please submit a pull request or get in touch. 

### Anything else?
Shoutout to [Kenneth](http://github.com/auchenberg) for digging out the Javascript functions and @luryus for hooking up the media keyboard keys
